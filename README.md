# Financial Analyzer

## Project Overview
The Financial Analyzer is a Python-based application designed to analyze financial reports and create interactive dashboards. It provides tools for data analysis and visualization of financial data.

## Current Architecture
The project is structured as follows:

- `financial_analyzer/`
  - `dashboard.py`: Contains functions for creating dashboards.
  - `data_analysis.py`: Includes functions for analyzing financial reports and managing dashboard configurations.
- `main.py`: The entry point of the application.
- `pyproject.toml`: Project configuration file.

## How It Works
1. The application reads financial data from a source (e.g., CSV files or databases).
2. The `analyze_report` function in `data_analysis.py` processes the data and generates analytical results.
3. The `create_dashboard` function in `dashboard.py` uses the analyzed data to create interactive visualizations.
4. Dashboard configurations can be saved and loaded using functions in `data_analysis.py`.
5. The `main.py` script orchestrates the overall flow of the application.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Run the App

1. Ensure you have Python 3.9+ and Poetry installed on your system.

2. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd financial-analyzer
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies using Poetry:
   ```
   poetry install
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   poetry shell
   ```

5. Run the main application:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

6. Follow the on-screen prompts to analyze financial reports and create dashboards.

## Configuration
You can customize the dashboard layout and analysis parameters by modifying the configuration files or using the built-in configuration management functions.
